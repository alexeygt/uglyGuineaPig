# Sails Example Using app.js and sails.io 
This is part of a series of screencasts which build a sails application from scratch.  You can follow the progress over at my github [sailscasts](http://irlnathan.github.io/sailscasts/) page.

- [Episode 20](http://irlnathan.github.io/sailscasts/blog/2013/09/06/building-a-sails-application-ep18-understanding-web-sockets-and-socket-io-including-room-creation-and-management/): In episode 20 you'll use an app to explore and understand how socket.io works within sails using a client side app that renders the majority of its views via ajax.  With four lines of code, the app monitors the user model and alerts any subscribing sockets with changes to the model.
